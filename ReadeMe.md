This program reads in two files and prints out the words in separate lines. Unfortunately I was unable to code the following functions:
create_alphabetical_array() 
print_words_alphabetically()

My code will only print out words in a separate line and count the number of words starting with a particular letter. 

To compile the code, type the following in your commandline: 
make alphabetical_printing

To run the code, type the following in your commandline: 
./alphabetical_printing

To clear all executables, type the following in your commandline: 
make clean
